Partial allows you to include custom blocks in your layouts. You can find all partials in the `themes/**/layouts/partials` directory.

Also we are using partials from Hugo Modules. You can find all modules on [Gethugothemes Hugo Module](https://gethugothemes.com/hugo-modules) page's **component** tab.
