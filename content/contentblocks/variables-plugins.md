To change website colors, fonts, and plugins. Please open the `my-project/hugo.toml` file.

## Change Website Colors

Under the `params.variables` section, you will have all the parameters to change the website color preferences. For example, if you change the value of `color_primary`, the primary color of the whole website.

example code:

```toml
[params.variables]
color_primary = "green"
color_secondary = "#001111"
body_color = "#fff"
text_color = "#666666"
text_dark = "#222222"
text_light = "#959595"
border_color = "#ACB9C4"
black = "#000"
white = "#fff"
light = "#fdfdfd"
```

## Change Website fonts

Below the color variables, you will get the font variables, and you can change the value of those variables as per your requirements.

Visit [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to see the fonts that are available to you. Then select the font you want to use. Then copy the **bold part** of the URL and paste it in the `font_primary` field. It will change the font of the website's primary text.

If you want to change the value of the primary font type, you can change it to either `sans-serif` or `serif` as per your requirement.

example code:

```toml
font_primary = "Roboto:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;1,400"
font_primary_type = "sans-serif" # [serif/sans-serif]
font_secondary = "Work+Sans"
font_secondary_type = "serif" # [serif/sans-serif]
icon_font = "Font Awesome 5 Free" # chose icon: https://fontawesome.com/icons
```

`font_size` and `font_scale` is pretty new to our themes. It's changed the full website font size. learn more about it [here](https://type-scale.com/). We have added the whole system of font sizes to our theme. So you can change the font sizes as per your requirement direct from **config.toml**.

example code:

```toml
# base font size for full website 
font_size = "16px" # default is 16px
font_scale = "1.25" # default is "majorThird": 1.25
# Font Scale Sizes
# "minorSecond": 1.067,
# "majorSecond": 1.125,
# "minorThird": 1.2,
# "majorThird": 1.25,
# "perfectFourth": 1.333,
# "augmentedFourth": 1.414,
# "perfectFifth": 1.5,
# "goldenRatio": 1.618
```

## Third-Party Plugins

You can add or remove third-party plugins from here. We create a loop for plugins. You can see two plugins loops here, the first one is for `css`, and the last one is for `js`.

Sometimes you need to close the Hugo server and run again for rendered correctly.
