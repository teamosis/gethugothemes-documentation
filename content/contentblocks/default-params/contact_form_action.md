**contact_form_action** is for activate your contact form. As Hugo generates a static site, so you need to activate this form by a third-party service. You can use any of them [Airform](https://airform.io/), [formspree](https://formspree.io/), or [Formsubmit](https://formsubmit.co/). Go to any of the sites that you preferred, and get your form action from there. Then, paste it here. If you use Airform, your form action will be like this: `https://airform.io/your@email.com`.
