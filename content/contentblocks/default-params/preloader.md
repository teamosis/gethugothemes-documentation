**preloader** is for your website preloader, which means it will show up until your website loads properly in the background. You can enable or disable preloader by setting the value of `enable` as `true` or `false`. If you want to put any image, logo, or animation as your preloader, give the file location in the `preloader =`, ex: `preloader = images/preloader.gif`.  If you donâ€™t want any logo or image, leave the preloader field empty. So it will show just a white screen when every component is loading.
