## Instagram Shortcode

```md
{{</* instagram BQD9zQQFQZ */>}}
```

If you want to display your Instagram photos, you can use the Instagram shortcode. You only need the photoâ€™s ID. You can find the ID in the URL of the photo. For example, the URL of the photo is <https://www.instagram.com/p/BQD9zQQFQZ/> and the ID is `BQD9zQQFQZ`.
