You can add third-party plugins from here. We create a loop for plugins. You will see two plugins loops here, the first one is for CSS, and the last one is for js. Copy a loop item that you need and paste it in the bottom of the loop. And link correctly after added plugins. You maybe need to close the Hugo server and run it for rendered correctly.
