We have predefined a layout for the new page. You can create a new page by running the following command:

```toml
hugo new new-page.md
```

## Duplicate an existing page

If you want to duplicate an existing page, you can copy that page and paste it where you want in the content folder. Then change the page name and title from the `front-matter`. Then you can change the content as per your requirement.
