Shortcodes are a way to add custom functionality to your contents. You can find all shortcodes in the `themes/**/layouts/shortcodes` directory.

Also we are using shortcodes from Hugo Modules. You can find all modules on [Gethugothemes Hugo Module](https://gethugothemes.com/hugo-modules) page's **shortcode** tab.
