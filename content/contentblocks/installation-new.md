## Setup Your Project

**Unzip** the downloaded file, and you will get **THEMEPATH** in the **themes** folder. Which is your Main Theme. You need to work with the Main Theme.
![unzip](../images/unzip.png)

**You can set up your project in two ways. (Follow any one of them)**

1. [Gethugothemes Exclusive Way (Recommended)](#gethugothemes-exclusive-way-recommended)
2. [Traditional Way](#traditional-way)

### Gethugothemes Exclusive Way (Recommended)

1. Open the `THEMEPATH` (Main Theme) with your favorite code editor. [[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended]

2. Open vscode terminal (ctrl+\`) and run the following command to setup your project.

    ```shell
    npm run project-setup
    ```

(If you have followed this, then go to the next step: [Run Your Project Locally](#run-your-project-locally))

<br>

### Traditional Way

1. Launch the **Terminal** and go to the specific location where you prefer to run your site.

    ![project-directory](/images/theme-installation/project-path.png)

2. Use the following command to create a new site. It will add a folder with your given **PROJECT NAME**.

    ```shell
    hugo new site my-project
    ```

    ![new-project](/images/theme-installation/new-project.png)

3. Copy the `themes/THEMEPATH` (from extracted zip) folder into the `my-project/themes` folder so that you end up with a folder structure like `my-project/themes/THEMEPATH/`

    ![copy-to-themes](../images/copy-theme.png)

4. Copy all files from the `my-project/themes/THEMEPATH/exampleSite` folder into the root folder (`my-project`). It will overwrites existing files and folders. You can delete the `exampleSite` folder afterward.

    ![copy-examplesite](../images/copy-examplesite.png)

5. Open `my-project` folder with your favorite code editor. [[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended]

## Run Your Project Locally

1. Open vscode terminal (ctrl+\`) and run the following command to install all dependencies.

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

2. Run the following command to start the development server.

    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Now, you get a generated URL and open it in your browser. The default URL looks like this [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313/).

{{< notice info >}}
If your website doesn't serve on your localhost, then check the `theme` name is correct in your `hugo.toml` file. Then run `npm run dev` command again.
{{< /notice >}}

## Build Your Project

After completing your development process, you need to build your project for production. You can build your project with the following command.

```shell
npm run build
```
