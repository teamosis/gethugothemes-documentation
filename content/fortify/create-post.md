Fortify is a multilingual template. So when you want to create a new post, you need to define the language. For example, creating a new post in the English language, the command is `hugo new english/blog/new-post.md` and for French it's `hugo new french/blog/new-post.md`.

## Configure Post

You can configure your blog post from the front-matter. Front-matter starts with `---` and end with also `---` . In this front matter you can give `author = author name`, `description = meta description`, `image = images/blog/post-thumb.jpg`, `categories` and `tags`.

When you created a new post, the `draft` default value is `true`, which means it's not published yet. Make it false to publish the post, ex: `draft = false`.
After closing the front matter, give your post content.

Remember that every file that has a `.md` extension supports markdown.
{{< /notice >}}
