We have predefined a layout for the new page. It's a multilingual template. To create a new page, you need to define the language name before the page name.

### Create a new page for the English Language

```toml
hugo new english/new-page.md
```

### Create a new page for the Deutsch Language

```toml
hugo new deutsch/new-page.md
```

## Duplicate an existing page
If you want to duplicate an existing page, you can copy that page and paste it where you want in the content folder. Then change the page name and title from the `front-matter`. Then you can change the content as per your requirement.
